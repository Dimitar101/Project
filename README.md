# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


To get the Project to work one needs a 'npm i' globally for the Project. Then the Client and Server are opened separately in two integrated Terminals. The Client integrated terminal needs 'npm run dev' and the Server integrated terminal needs 'node server.js'!!!
