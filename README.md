###### Project’s Title: dd!

'dd!' is an interactive online learning platform designed to help kids grow their skills at their own pace, while also providing the inspiration needed to do so. With quizzes and practice modules, 'dd!' makes learning engaging, flexible, and effective—anytime, anywhere.



To get the Project to work one needs a 'npm i' globally for the Project. A practise server is provided with the files. Then the Client and Server are opened separately in two integrated Terminals. The Client integrated terminal requires 'npm run dev' and the Server integrated terminal requires 'node server.js'!!!

The **server** is credited to: https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server?tab=readme-ov-file#services

The Project uses React + Vite for the client side.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

The Project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSX (JavaScript) for the component part of the *Client* side. Some images are provided locally via an assets file and some are loaded from external source.
